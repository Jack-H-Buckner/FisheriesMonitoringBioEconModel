Code to solve continuous state partially observable markov decision prcesses 
and belief sate MDPs. The beleif state dynamics are aproximated by the 
unscented Kalman filter. This allows for rapid, though aproximate, computation
of beleif states dynamics which inturn facilitates the use of standard 
continuous state MDP solution techniques.
