    "In this note book I use the code developed to solve beleif state MDPs to find optimal invetment strategies in monitoring for fisheries manamgent. I assume managers set harvest levels based on noisy observatiosn of the populations biomass at the end of each period and that they can choose to invest in more accurate measurements. In a base case I assume they attempt to maximize the discounted stream of harvest net the costs of monitoring. I also consider a case where tehy maximize for log harvest levels to determine the effects of risk aversion and a case where there is a penelty for low total abundace to determine the effects of a joint harvest and conservation objective. \n",

    "Evaluating the right hand side of the bellman equation requires numerical procedures to aproximate the value function, solve the maximzation problem, evaluate the integrals inside the manximizatin opperator, and methods to aproximate the state transtions.

    "The decision makers beleif about the true state of the system can in principal be any probabiltiy distribution with with support $R^+$. However in order to solve the decision problem using value function iteration we need to aproximate this potentially infinite dimensional state space with a finite dimensional one. Here we achieve this using a method called density projection. In essence we aproximate the true beleif state with a parametric distribution and use the parameters of this distribution as the state varaible. In this case we applied a log transformed to the dynamcis of the system and represented the decision makers beleif about the log state of the system with a normal distribution. With this aproximation our beleif state $s$ are in the set $\\{(\\mu,\\sigma)|\\mu \\in R, \\sigma \\in R\\}$, and $P(x|s) = \\phi(\\frac{log(x)-\\mu}{\\sigma})$. "

This allso allowed us to compute the second integral in bellmans equation using Guas-Hermite weights and nodes because the probability density $P(y_{t+1}|b)$ is aproximated as a normal distirbution with mean $E[x_{t+1}]$ and variance $V[x_{t+1}] + \\sigma_{obs}^2$, where $\\sigma_{obs}^2$ is the variance of the observaiton model. \n",
